Hello

I am a Fulbright Scholar and MA Candidate at the [Juan March Institute of Social Sciences](https://ic3jm.es) (IC3JM) at [Carlos III Unversity of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home). I received a BBA in International Business with an emphasis in Economics.

As an economic sociologist, my research primarily focuses on the sociology of work in postindustrial economies. I am particularly interested in the effect of economic institutions on cognitive logics, particularly within the context of labor and financial markets.
