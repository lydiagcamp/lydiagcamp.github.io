I am a Fulbright Scholar and MA Candidate at the [Juan March Institute of Social Sciences](https://ic3jm.es) (IC3JM) at [Carlos III University of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home) (UC3M). I received a BBA in International Business with an emphasis in Economics.

As an economic sociologist, my research primarily focuses on the sociology of work in postindustrial economies. I am broadly interested in the effect of economic institutions on cognitive logics, with particular attention to labor and financial markets. My research follows two interconnected lines of inquiry. The first examines the financialization of the middle class, analyzing the social consequences of engagement with financial instruments ranging from stocks to employee ownership schemes. The second investigates occupational communities, emphasizing the role of social networks in producing stratification and labor market precarity.
