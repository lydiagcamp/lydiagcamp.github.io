## Works in Progress

- *[Stability Pays Dividends: Financial Market Exposure & Political Risk](/files/FMESample.pdf)*  
  **Abstract:** This paper examines the impact of financial market exposure on partisan identification in the United Kingdom (1999–2020), finding that low levels of stock market participation increase alignment with the political right. However, I find that greater financial market exposure shifts support toward incumbents through the proposed mechanisms of risk aversion and social buy-in, pointing to the political function of financial inclusion.
- *The Embedded Economy of Woolf: In Search of the Imaginative Life*  
  **Abstract:** This paper examines Virginia Woolf’s literary works as economic texts, portraying her as an “economic thinker” who engages with material wealth, middle-class guilt, and discriminatory education systems. It situates Woolf within early twentieth-century economic thought, showing how her ideas, influenced by her friendship with J. M. Keynes, contribute to a women-centered, embedded framework for economic life.
