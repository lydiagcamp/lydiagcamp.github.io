- *Stability Pays Dividends: Financial Market Exposure & Political Risk*
**Abstract:** This paper investigates the causal impact of financial market exposure on par- tisan identification, using longitudinal data from the United Kingdom that spans from 1999 to 2020. While prior studies have emphasized a correlation between financial exposure and right-wing attitudes, I argue that this relationship only ex- ists at relatively low levels of stock market participation. As a larger proportion of income is derived from investment activities, financial market exposure instead provokes support for political incumbents, irrespective of party ideology. This effect occurs through two key channels: (1) rational risk aversion, in which participants compensate for financial uncertainty with political stability, and (2) social buy-in, whereby recurring investment income strengthens identification with domestic insti- tutions. Leveraging fixed effects in panel data, interactions with party incumbency, and an instrumental variable based on regional variation in financial education, this study finds robust evidence that financial market exposure initially increases alignment with the political right; however, this effect becomes incumbent-biased once investment income is relatively high. These findings offer novel insights into financial inclusion as a strategic and political tool in contemporary democracies
